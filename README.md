Then save the page to your machine (anywhere you prefer).  Open this file in a web browser and
you can start to explore it's structure.

Open the browsers developer tools to look at the HTML structure. Most web browsers use F-12 to
open the developer tools.  The instructor should be able to help if you're unable to find how to
open developer tools in your favorite browser.

Once you have the file and the developer tools open - navigate to the "Elements" tab of the
developer tools panel (the very top of the image below).

You should see this image:
